       "{'sequence': 'Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field.

The film differs substantially from the novel.\\n\\nPrincipal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in the United States released that year and earned over US$678.2 million worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind The Lion King. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies.

It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards.\\n\\nVarious interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film\\'s political symbolism.
